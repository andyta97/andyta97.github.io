    <div class="container p-3 my-3 bg-dark text-white text-center">
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Growing up, I've always had an interest in technology. My family wasn't well-off financially, so a lot of the technology I had was old and outdated.
            One particular piece of hardware I always used was my old Dell Inspiron that ran Windows XP from 2006 to 2012. 50% of my time with that laptop was spent fixing it rather than actually using it. There
            was always some weird issue with it, such as the cooling fan not working, black screen on boot up, or the keyboard wouldn't work. At some point, it became the Ship of Theseus. I replaced and changed so many parts
            that it became an enitrely new laptop. I fondly remember this laptop, mainly with hatred honestly, but it did fuel my passion for technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            I began attending the University of Oklahoma in 2016 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Math. However, in 2018, I decided to switch my major after not liking the courses offered in the Computer
            Science major. I thought about various other technology related majors. Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering both sounded good to me, but a part of me didn't want to stick with engineering. I learned
            from a friend about Management Information Systems (MIS), a business major that tangentially involved technology and business.
        </p>

        <p>
            The fall of that year I officially declared myself as a MIS major, and since then, I've immensely enjoyed my experience with the program. I've made great friends and interacted with wonderful professors during my time with the program.
            I will graduate in May 2021 with a bachelor of business administration degree in MIS.
