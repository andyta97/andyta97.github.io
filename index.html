        <h1>Welcome to Andy Ta's personal website!</h1>

        <p>This is a personal website I created to share various information about me. On display, I have information about my life,
        my skills, and various projects I've finished! Consider this site to be my portfolio and resume that I wish to share with
        future employers or colleagues.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>My name is Andy Ta. I'm currently a senior at the University of Oklahoma, and I am majoring in Management
        Information systems. I plan on graduating in May 2021 with a bachelor's degree.</p>
