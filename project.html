        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Here are some projects I've done while taking my courses at the University of Oklahoma!</p>

        <h2>Pokédex</h2>

        <p>In my Non-Procedural Programming class, I built a Pokédex from the Pokémon series. It allows the user to pick a Pokémon
        from a list and it displays information about the Pokémon.</p>

        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>

        <p>In my Non-Procedural Programming class, I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The user
        can play Tic-Tac-Toe, and it even keeps track of how many times each side has won.</p>

        <h2>Elysian Database Project</h2>
        <p>In my Database Management class, my group and I created a database to keep track of a fictional company's data. Over 15 queries
        were also created to keep track of various information that the client wanted such as top sales for an item per month or how much
        a product sold out. I'm still in the process of finishing this with my groupmmates, and a link will be added as soon as the
        project is finished!</p>
